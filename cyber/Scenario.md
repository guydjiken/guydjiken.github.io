## Scenario

As a security analyst at a large financial services company, you receive an urgent alert that an employee has received a phishing email in their inbox. Upon reviewing the alert, you identify a suspicious domain in the email body: signin.office365x24.com, which closely mimics legitimate services. This raises immediate concerns about a potential phishing campaign targeting multiple employees.

Your task is to swiftly investigate whether any other employees have received similar phishing emails containing this domain and whether any company devices have attempted to access the malicious domain. Utilizing Google Chronicle SIEM, you will:

- Conduct a thorough domain search to track all occurrences of signin.office365x24.com across your organization.

- Analyze any network activity linked to this domain to identify users who might have interacted with it.

- Investigate associated threat intelligence to assess the risk level and understand potential impacts on the organization's assets.

- Take action to contain the threat by notifying affected users and implementing security measures to block further access to the domain.

This investigation is critical to preventing data breaches, securing sensitive financial data, and protecting the organization's reputation.
