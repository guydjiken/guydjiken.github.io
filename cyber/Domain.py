# Pseudo Python code for domain search and analysis in Chronicle SIEM
# perform_domain_search() function queries Chronicle SIEM for the specified domain (signin.office365x24.com) and retrieves any logs or events associated with it.
# analyze_historical_data() function checks the search results for email records to see if other employees received emails containing the suspicious domain.
#identify_network_activity() function scans the search results for any network activity, such as DNS queries or attempts to visit the domain, and logs the devices involved.
# document_findings() function logs the domain, affected employees, and network activity in the incident handler's journal for further action.
